# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Project Overview:

For this challenge, I used the skills that I learned through the course of Module 13 to create a geographical map with earthquake and tectonic plate data as overlays. My map is interactive and displays earthquake data from the past 7 days, in relation to the location of the Earth's tectonic plates. The map also displays and differentiates earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5. You have 3 different mapbox map styles to choose from: "Streets", "Satellite Streets" and "Outdoors."

## Main Objectives: Module 13

1. Create a branch from the main branch on GitHub.
2. Add, commit, and push data to a GitHub branch.
3. Merge a branch with the main branch on GitHub.
4. Retrieve data from a GeoJSON file.
5. Make API requests to a server to host geographical maps.
6. Populate geographical maps with GeoJSON data using JavaScript and the Data-Driven Documents (D3) library.
7. Add multiple map layers to geographical maps using Leaflet control plugins to add user interface controls.
8. Use JavaScript ES6 functions to add GeoJSON data, features, and interactivity to maps.
9. Render maps on a local server.
